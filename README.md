# rpi-build-qt-pyqt

Build Qt 5 and PyQt5 on the Raspberry Pi platform

# Overview

This project contains scripts for building Qt natively on the Raspberry Pi platform. It includes the Qt libraries and tools (e.g. qmake) for developing Qt-based applications on the Raspberry Pi. Also included are binaries (in the form of tar archives) for various versions of Qt that will run under the Raspbian Linux distribution. As building Qt natively is very time consuming, these are provided for the convenience of developers who want to use a recent version of Qt on the Raspberry Pi platform running Raspbian.

Note that if you want to do significant Qt development for the Raspberry Pi, it is generally recommended to set up a cross-compiled development environment running on a faster desktop computer. While more complex to initially set up, this will usually pay off in reduced build times.

Also note that Raspbian Linux includes packages for Qt 5.7.1. If this version is new enough for you, you may want to use the official Raspbian/Debian Qt packages rather that the ones provided here.

# Building

If you want to build these images yourself, you can run the provided script (qtbuild.sh) on a Raspberry Pi system. It is recommended that you configure the system (using raspi-config) to boot into a text console and not run the graphical desktop. I have had issues with the Raspberry Pi rebooting during the build. If so, you can manually restart it.

There are a number of packages which need to be installed in order to built Qt. Here is a list which may not be entirely complete or accurate (you can install them with sudo apt-get <package names...>):

```

Expect the build to take many hours on a Raspberry Pi 3 (on the order of eight hours for the minimal build, 24 hours for a full build).

# Installing

Download the desired binary archive, e.g. Qt5.10.1-RaspberryPi3-bin-full.tgz, and then install it using commands like this:

```
cd /
sudo tar xf /home/pi/Qt5.10.1-RaspberryPi3-bin-full.tgz
```

Qt Creator can be installed in a similar way, e.g.
```
cd /
sudo tar xf /home/pi/QtCreator4.6.2-Qt5.9.6-RaspberryPi3-bin.tgz
```

You can then run qmake specifying the full path, e.g. /usr/local/Qt-5.10.1/bin/qmake. You may want to add the Qt binary directory (e.g. /usr/local/Qt-5.10.1/bin) to your path.

Qt Creator can be run as "qtcreator" (it gets installed in /usr/local/bin/qtcreator).

# Known Issues and Limitations

The binaries have only had minimal testing. Both the xcb and eglfs rendering back ends should work and there is support for both widgets and QML.

The binaries support Raspbian Linux and the Raspberry Pi 3 only.

The QtWebengine and QtLocation modules are not included as they require more memory to build than is available on a Raspberry Pi 3 (you might be able to compile them if you add swap space).

Qt 5.11.0 and later requires a newer version of libclang to build the documentation than is currently available in Raspbian. The Qt documentation is currently not available in these builds.

The Qt Creator binary is built against a specific version of Qt. That version needs to be installed in order to run it. You can install multiple versions of Qt if desired, provided that you have enough disk space.

The software was built on a Raspian system based on the "stretch" release. It won't run on the older "jessie" release.

It is not using hardware (GPU) OpenGL, so OpenGL performance will be poor.

# Future Plans

The following are some features that are being considered for the future:

- Add QtWebEngine and QtLocation modules
- Offer Debian format packages
- Provide cross-compilation packages
- Add builds for other Raspberry Pi models
